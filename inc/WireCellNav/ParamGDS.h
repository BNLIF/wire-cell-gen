	 * This class defines three planes of wires.  
	 *
	 * Within one plane, all wires are parallel and separated by a
	 * uniform pitch and the planes are transverse to the given
	 * "drift" direction.
	 *
	 * The wire planes will be bounded by a rectangular solid
	 * defined by its two diagonally apposed corners.  These
	 * points determine the coordinate system of the resulting
	 * wires.
	 *
	 * Each wire plane is defined by two 3-vectors. The "offset"
	 * vector is interpreted to point from the minimum boundary
	 * point to a point on the first wire of the view.  The
	 * "pitch" vector is interpreted to run perpendicular to the
	 * wires in the plane and with a magnitude equal to the pitch
	 * between the wires.
	 *
	 * Note, this class does not implement wire wrapping.  Wire
	 * and channel ID numbers are equated.
