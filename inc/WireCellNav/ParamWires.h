	 * Three planes of wires are generated and labeled, U, V and
	 * W.  There is no internal convention as to which plane is
	 * which except that the label indicates the direction that
	 * their wires point (and not their transverse pitch
	 * direction).
	 *
	 * The coordinate conventions are defined as:
	 * 
	 * - wire planes are parallel to the Y-Z plane.
	 *
	 * - electrons drift in the negative-X direction.
	 *
	 * - wire angles are measured in the Y-Z plane w.r.t. the
	 *   direction of the Y-axis.
	 *
	 * - cross-product of the direction of a plane's wires to the
	 *   direction of the plane's pitch is the direction of drift
	 *   (WxP=D).
	 *
	 * Thus wire angles
	 *
	 * - (0,90)  : wires point in +Y,-Z direction, pitch in +Y,+Z
	 * - (90,180): wires point in -Y,-Z direction, pitch in +Y,-Z
	 * 
	 * The wires planes are fully specified by four rays.
	 *
	 * \param bounds is a WireCell::Ray with its tail at the
	 * negative-most corner and its head at the positive-most
	 * corner of a rectangular bounding box.  All wires will be
	 * constructed so that they terminate on the walls of this
	 * box.
	 *
	 * \param U is a WireCell::Ray which is in the wire plane and
	 * points in a direction perpendicular to the wire direction.
	 * Both tail and head points should be inside the bounding box
	 * and on wires.
	 *
	 * \param V is same but same for V wire plane.
	 *
	 * \param W is same but for for W wire plane.
	 *
	 * Note, this class does not implement wire wrapping.  Wire
	 * and channel ID numbers are equated.
